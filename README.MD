# Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones with Interceptions (VRPDi) Optimization

An implementation and optimization of algorithms for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones with Interceptions (VRPDi), featuring Ant Colony System (ACS) with K-means clustering and local search improvements.

## Problem Description

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones with Interceptions (VRPDi) is a modern extension of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that addresses the growing demands of e-commerce delivery optimization. This problem was first introduced by Tsietsi John Moremi in 2022.

### Key Features of VRPDi

- **Environmental Consideration**: Uses drones to reduce fuel emissions and environmental impact
- **Interception Capability**: Drones can return to trucks while trucks are still in transit, unlike traditional VRPD
- **Delivery Optimization**: Minimizes delivery time and costs while serving more customers
- **Real-world Application**: Addresses the increasing volume of goods transportation in online shopping

### Problem Advantages

VRPDi offers a new perspective on delivery time optimization compared to traditional VRPD:
- Drones don't need to wait for trucks at pickup locations
- More flexible coordination between vehicles and drones
- Improved overall delivery efficiency
